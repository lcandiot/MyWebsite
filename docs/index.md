## ðŸ‘‹ A Bit About Me

I enjoy building models, writing code, and working with people who like solving hard problems.
My work sits at the intersection of geoscience, fluid mechanics, and machine learning â€” always with a focus on practical application.

Currently, Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at ETH ZÃ¼rich where I develop reactive transport models and AI-driven workflows for subsurface systems. Iâ€™ve also worked as a CAE engineer in industry, applying CFD and FEM tools to improve product performance and time to market.

I share code, projects, and thoughts here â€” feel free to explore and reach out.

## ðŸš€ What I Work On

I study the **dynamics of our planet** through highâ€‘fidelity simulations â€”  
from **mantle convection** and **mountain building** to **reactive fluid systems**.  
My focus is on **numerical modeling** that transforms complex geoscientific processes  
into **insightful and reproducible simulations**.

### Research Projects

- **Mountain Building & Subduction Modeling** â€”  
  Long-term thermoâ€‘mechanical simulations of lithosphereâ€“mantle interactions  
  to explore subduction initiation and slab detachment.

<!-- - **Reactive Fluid Systems** â€”  
  Coupled flow and chemical models to understand subsurface processes  
  relevant to energy, resources, and natural hazards. -->

<!-- - **AIâ€‘Enhanced Geoscience** â€”  
  Integrating **machine learning and automatic differentiation**  
  to accelerate and extend classical simulation methods. -->
