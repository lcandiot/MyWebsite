<!-- About section -->
<section class="about-section">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I enjoy building models, writing code, and working with people who like solving hard problems. 

  My work sits at the intersection of geoscience, fluid mechanics, and machine learning — always with a focus on practical application.

  Currently, I’m a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich where I develop reactive transport models and AI-driven workflows for subsurface systems. I’ve also worked as a CAE engineer in industry, applying CFD and FEM tools to improve product performance and time to market.

  I share code, projects, and thoughts here — feel free to explore and reach out.
