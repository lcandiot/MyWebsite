## 👋 A Bit About Me

I enjoy building models, writing code, and working with people who like solving hard problems.
My work sits at the intersection of geoscience, fluid mechanics, and machine learning — always with a focus on practical application.

Currently, I’m a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich where I develop reactive transport models and AI-driven workflows for subsurface systems. I’ve also worked as a CAE engineer in industry, applying CFD and FEM tools to improve product performance and time to market.

I share code, projects, and thoughts here — feel free to explore and reach out.

## 🧪 Projects

Welcome to a selection of projects spanning research, engineering, and simulation software.
Each one reflects a different way I approach complex systems — with a mix of coding, modeling, and physics.

## 🧰 Technologies

- Julia, Python, OpenFOAM, Pluto.jl, Jupyter
- Multiphase Flow · Structural Mechanics · ML Integration
