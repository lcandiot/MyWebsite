# ðŸš€ Building My Personal Website with VitePress and ChatGPT

This summer, I decided to finally build my own website ðŸŒž.
My goal was simple: create a landing page where people interested in working with me could get an authentic first impression.

I wanted it to:
* Showcase my research, coding skills, and professional profile in one place ðŸ’»
* Be aesthetic, minimal, and easy to implement
* Reflect my personality, passion, and profession â€” without taking up my entire vacation

## âš¡ Why I Chose VitePress

As someone familiar with Markdown and GitHub, VitePress was the natural choice.
* Itâ€™s extremely lightweight and developerâ€‘friendly
* Supports Markdownâ€‘based pages and custom layouts
* Offers a clean, technical aesthetic that matched my style

I could focus on content instead of wrestling with complicated frameworks.


## ðŸ¤– My Experience with ChatGPT as a Coâ€‘Developer

Iâ€™ve been using ChatGPT as a development sparring partner for a while now, and it still amazes me how much it accelerates my projects.

Instead of spending hours searching for syntax details, debugging HTML, or trying to structure content, I can:
* Brainstorm layouts and workflows in real time
* Fix technical issues within seconds
* Streamline entire projects by letting ChatGPT suggest structure and best practices

This approach doesnâ€™t just save time â€” it keeps me in the creative flow.
I can focus on what I actually want to build, while ChatGPT takes care of the small obstacles that usually slow things down

In many ways, working like this feels like pair programming with an AI:
it challenges me to reflect on my choices, while giving me the confidence to move faster toward a polished result âœ…


## ðŸŽ¯ Takeaway

If youâ€™re a developer looking for a fast and flexible way to launch a personal website, I can highly recommend VitePress.
Pair it with a bit of AI guidance, and you can go from idea to live site in just a few sessions ðŸš€
