# ðŸ§  Using Julia for Reactive Transport Modeling

Julia has become my go-to language for scientific computing.

In this post, I share how I combine:

**-** **Automatic differentiation** (Zygote, Enzyme)

**-** **Machine learning models** (Lux.jl, Flux.jl)

**-** **Classical numerical methods**

â€¦to simulate **reactive transport and subsurface fluid flow** in my research.
