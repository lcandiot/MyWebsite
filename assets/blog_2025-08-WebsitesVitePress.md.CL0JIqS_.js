I can focus on what I actually want to build, while ChatGPT takes care of the small obstacles that usually slow things down.</p><p>In many ways, working like this feels like pair programming with an AI: it challenges me to reflect on my choices, while giving me the confidence to move faster toward a polished result ✅</p><h2 id="🎯-takeaway" tabindex="-1">🎯 Takeaway <a class="header-anchor" href="#🎯-takeaway" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🎯 Takeaway&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you’re a developer looking for a fast and flexible way to launch a personal website, I can highly recommend VitePress.
