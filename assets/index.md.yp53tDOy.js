My work lives where geoscience, fluid mechanics, and machine learning meet, always with a focus on keeping it practical and useful. </p><p> Right now, I’m a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich, creating reactive transport models and AI-driven workflows for subsurface systems. Before that, I worked as a CAE engineer in industry, using CFD and FEM tools to boost product performance and speed up development. </p><p> I’m always happy to connect, swap ideas, and explore new projects in science, data analysis, machine learning, and engineering. If any of that sounds interesting to you, drop me a message.
